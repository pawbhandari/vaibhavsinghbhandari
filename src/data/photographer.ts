  approach: `My photography is guided by three principles: authenticity, composition, and light. I believe the best images emerge when subjects feel comfortable and genuine, when composition guides the viewer's eye naturally, and when light reveals the essence of the moment.

Whether working on editorial assignments or commercial projects, I strive to create images that transcend their immediate purpose and become lasting visual statements.`,
